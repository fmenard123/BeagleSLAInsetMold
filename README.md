Buster Beagle Mold TEMPLATE for SLA Insets

This TEMPLATE was designed in Solidworks and is fully parametric, so you can make changes.
Please adjust all design parameters to match your required part size, clamp force, and injection force. 
The inner core of the mold must match the 2 degree angled draft of the mold shell. This will prevent the mold insets from falling through the mold shells upon separating the mold.
There are no threads in the M6x1mm holes on the four corners.
The dowel pins are optional but will assist in aligning the two mold halves if the fabrication is not precise.
Please upload your changes to Github the the fmenard123/BeagleSLAInsetMold repository.
If any product makes use of these files, you must make the raw source files availables to the community in compliance with the GNU Public License 3.0.
Please do not ask for a Fusion 360 file... as the aim here is to be able to make use of the comprehensive suite of Solidworks products, including Mold Tools, Solidworks Plastics and Simula.
